    "**Note:** This is the accompanying notebook for Chapter 4 - Automate document processing workflows. Before executing the code in this notebook, please review chapter 4 in the book and the Read Me included along with this notebook. To demonstrate accessing APIs and to see how the solution works step by step we use this Jupyter notebook in the book. You can however build this whole solution using AWS Lambda with event triggers that are alerted whenever a task is completed (for example, you can use the start_entities_detection_job API and setup a Amazon CloudWatch event rule to be triggered when the job is complete, which can execute an AWS Lambda function to perform the next set of steps. Please refer to the Further Reading section in the book to refer to a github repository of this solution deployed using AWS CloudFormation and AWS Lambda. \n",
