        <h2>Who we are and what we do</h2>
        <h4><p>A wholly owned subsidiary of LiveRight, we are the nation's largest bank for SMB owners and cooperative societies, with more than 4500 branches spread across the nation, servicing more than 5 million customers and continuing to grow.
          We offer a number of lending products to our customers including checking and savings accounts, lending, credit cards, deposits, insurance, IRA and more. Started in 1787 as a family owned business providing low interest loans for farmers struggling with poor harvests, LiveRight helped these farmers design long distance water channels from lakes in neighboring districts
             to their lands. The initial success helped these farmers invest their wealth in LiveRight and later led to our cooperative range of products that allowed farmers to own a part of LiveRight.
             In 1850 we moved our HeadQuarters to New York city to help build the economy of our nation by providing low interest lending products to small to medium business owners looking to start or expand their business.
              From 2 branches then to 4500 branches today, the trust of our customers helped us grow to become the nation's largest SMB bank. </p>
